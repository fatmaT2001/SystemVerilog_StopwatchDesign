#Repository Description:
Discover a digital stopwatch design implemented in SystemVerilog. This project presents a practical application of HDL in creating time-keeping devices, showcasing HTML for the interface and Stata for analysis. Ideal for learners and professionals in digital design and FPGA development.

Based on the information from your GitHub repository "stopwatch," here are the new name, description, and a detailed README file:

## Overview
Welcome to the SystemVerilog Stopwatch Design repository. This project features a digital stopwatch implemented in SystemVerilog, along with an HTML interface and statistical analysis in Stata. It's a practical demonstration of hardware description language (HDL) capabilities in designing and simulating digital systems.

## Project Highlights
- Digital stopwatch design using SystemVerilog.
- HTML-based user interface for interaction.
- Stata for performance analysis and data handling.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine and explore the various components of the stopwatch design. The project is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of digital design using SystemVerilog.

## Requirements
- SystemVerilog compatible simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado).
- Web browser for HTML interface.
- Stata for statistical analysis (optional).

## Usage
1. Simulate the SystemVerilog files using your preferred HDL simulator.
2. Open the HTML files in a web browser to interact with the stopwatch interface.
3. Analyze the design's performance and data using Stata scripts.
